## **M.S. Graduate Research Assistantship for Nightjar Conservation and Ecology**    

*Start Date:* August 2024  

*Last Day to Apply*: For full consideration, applications must be received by May 1, 2024.     

*Salary*: $22,000/yr + tuition and health care access    

*Description*
A M.S.-level Graduate Research Assistantship is available at Southern Illinois University starting Fall 2024 for leading research and conservation efforts of nightjars (eastern whip-poor-will and chuck-will’s-widow) in southern Illinois. Like most aerial insectivores in North America, both chuck-will’s-widow and eastern whip-poor-will are declining, with the former currently listed as state threatened and whip-poor-will currently under consideration for listing. We seek a highly motivated graduate student to lead research on estimating species distribution and abundance in the region, with a focus on identifying key ecological drivers of population change. The research will occur across priority conservation areas and also will work to understand how forest management and restoration efforts impact the recovery of the species. Field work will take place during spring and summer and will include deploying Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs), conducting nocturnal point counts, and vegetation surveys. Additionally, the student will supplement the nightjar monitoring with insect monitoring efforts at select areas. The successful applicant is expected to communicate findings to state agencies and other on-going monitoring efforts. The student will earn a M.S. in Forestry with emphasis in Wildlife Ecology at Southern Illinois University. To learn more about our group, visit peaselab.com and forestry.siu.edu. The student will be co-advised by Drs. Brent Pease (bpease1@siu.edu; peaselab.com) and Dr. Eric Holzmueller (eholzmue@siu.edu) in the Forestry program at SIU.
     
*Qualifications*
The successful applicant will have (1) obtained B.S. degree in wildlife, ecology, biology, forestry, zoology, or related fields; (2) knowledge of regional birds by sight and sound and have experience deploying ARUs and conducting point counts; (3) exceptional quantitative skills and familiarity with occupancy modeling and distance sampling for abundance estimation; (4) knowledge of program R and spatial software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS); (5) a driver's license and ability to conduct independent field work in difficult conditions (e.g., steep terrain, poison ivy, ticks, venomous snakes); (6) ability to work in a team setting and (7) strong oral and written communication skills.

## **Ph.D. Assistantship  – Density estimation using ARUs – Southern Illinois University**    

*Start Date:* April/May 2024  

*Last Day to Apply*: For full consideration, applications must be received by Dec 1, 2023, but will be accepted until Dec 15, 2023.     

*Salary*: $25,000/yr + tuition and health care access    

*Description*
A Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistantship in the PEASE Lab (Population Estimation and Spatial Ecology; peaselab.com) at Southern Illinois University is available starting April/May 2024 to develop density estimation methods using Autonomous Recorders Units (ARUs; sound recorders) for threatened and endangered bird species in managed forests. The research will be in a 100-year forest management experiment, the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment (www.heeforeststudy.org), which currently uses a traditional point count system for monitoring bird species of concern. The student will initially be tasked with developing a full cost/benefit and efficacy analysis of transitioning the study system to an ARU-based monitoring framework. Following this, the student will develop a simulation study to aid in the design, arrangement, and deployment of ARUs for density estimation; the simulation may be supplemented with field data. The student will then use the framework to estimate densities of eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus) and hooded warbler (Setophaga citrina), among other species, which will be collected in-field over a 3 year period. Nearly 20 years of point count data currently exist, and the student will also be expected to carry out hierarchical community analyses of current dataset. Opportunities exist for the student to develop independent research ideas. 

The selected student will have extensive experience deploying ARUs along with processing and analyzing acoustic data. Students with an interest in developing and applying state-of-the-art quantitative approaches in wildlife conservation are particularly encouraged to apply. The student should also be excited about carrying out field work during summers in southern Indiana and southern Illinois in difficult field conditions, and should have a general interest and knowledge of forest management techniques. The successful applicant is expected to communicate findings to state agencies and other on-going, regional monitoring efforts. The student will earn a Ph.D. in Agricultural Sciences at Southern Illinois University. The preferred start date is April 2024, but a later start date may be negotiated for top candidates. 
This is a well-funded, multi-agency research project, and the graduate student will be expected to assist in hiring and managing field technicians to support the data collection efforts in Indiana. That said, the project has anticipated final funding approval date of Early 2023, and the positions are subject to final funding approval. 

Please see our lab website (https://peaselab.com/) and the SIU Forestry Program’s homepage (https://coas.siu.edu/academics/departments/forestry/) for more information on our research and academic department. 
     
     
*Qualifications*
The successful applicant will have (1) obtained M.S. degree in wildlife, ecology, biology, forestry, zoology, or related fields; (2) knowledge of regional birds by sight and sound and have extensive experience with ARUs; (3) knowledge of and interest in forest management techniques, (4) exceptional quantitative skills with experience estimating distribution and/or abundance using a variety of data types and models; (5) knowledge of program R and spatial software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS); (6) a driver's license and ability to conduct independent field work in difficult conditions (e.g., steep terrain, poison ivy, ticks, venomous snakes); and (7) strong oral and written communication skills.
    
    
*Apply:* 
To apply please email a single PDF to Dr. Brent Pease (bpease1@siu.edu) that includes: 
1. A cover letter that describes your specific interest in this position and how your past experiences and career goals align with the goals of the project
2. Curriculum Vitae (with GPA and GRE scores included)
3. Undergraduate transcripts and graduate transcripts (unofficial is acceptable)
4. Example of writing (e.g., M.S. thesis or publication; can be included separately as PDF).
4. Contact information for 3 references
The email subject should be “PhD – Density Estimation”. Review of applications will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled, which may occur before the close of the position. For full consideration, applications must be received by Dec 1, 2023, but applications will be accepted until Dec 15, 2023.

__**Undergraduate students**__: I am particularly interested in working with motivated undergraduates that are seeking research experience. I currently serve as a mentor for undergraduate students in the [SI Bridges](https://sibridges.siu.edu/) program as well as the [Dorris Duke Conservation Scholar Program](https://www.ddcf.org/funding-areas/environment/doris-duke-conservation-scholars-program/). While I have many projects that you could contribute to, I am open to exploring new ideas with you. Please send me a brief [email](mailto:bpease1@siu.edu) with your current resume and we can discuss potential projects.    

__**Graduate students**__: While I wish I could support endless graduate students, I am, of course, limited by available funding. When opportunities are available, I will post them to the [Texas A&M Job Board](https://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/). I welcome general inquiries and may be able to find alternative funding sources for *exceptional* candidates. I am also open to working to develop competitive fellowship applications. If you think your research interests and career goals align with the direction of our work, please [email](mailto:bpease1@siu.edu) me a short letter describing your experiences and research interests, along with your CV.     

__**Post-Doctoral Scholars**__: I am especially interested in working with researchers that have strong quantitative and/or geospatial interests and skills. If you think the lab is a good fit, send me an [email](mailto:bpease1@siu.edu) describing your interests along with a CV and we can find a time to chat.

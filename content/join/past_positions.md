A M.S. Graduate Research Assistantship is available at Southern Illinois University (SIU) starting August 2022 to model the distribution dynamics of swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus aquaticus) over a 20+ year period. As a Species of Conservation Concern, swamp rabbits are an important indicator species of bottomland hardwood forests but are experiencing declines throughout their range, primarily due to the loss of bottomland hardwood forests. The graduate student will be tasked with surveying swamp rabbits throughout southernmost Missouri and using the occurrence data to 1) estimate the current distribution and status of swamp rabbits in Missouri, 2) understand the drivers of change in their distribution through dynamic occupancy modelling, with a particular interest in understanding landscape and management-related factors, and 3) provide evidence to aid in agency decision-making around the management and conservation of the species. The graduate student will be expected to have a keen interest in learning and applying cutting-edge statistical techniques with an emphasis in Bayesian inference. Opportunities may exist for the student to develop independent research questions and projects including but not limited to species distribution modeling, quantitative ecology, and/or structured decision making. This is a collaborative project with the Missouri Department of Conservation and the Forestry Program at Southern Illinois University, and the successful applicant is expected to effectively communicate findings to all partners. The student will earn a M.S. in Forestry at Southern Illinois University and will be advised by Dr. Brent Pease, in close collaboration with Drs. Clayton Nielsen and John Groninger (SIU Forestry Program).    

This is a well-funded, multi-agency research project, and the graduate student will be expected to assist in hiring and managing several field technicians to support the data collection efforts in Missouri. That said, the project has anticipated final funding approval date of June 2022, and the positions are subject to final funding approval.    

The successful applicant will have (1) obtained B.S. degree in wildlife, ecology, biology, forestry, zoology, or related fields; (2) knowledge of rabbit ecology and/or bottomland hardwood forest ecology; (3) exceptional quantitative skills with an interest in learning and applying advanced occupancy modeling under Bayesian inference; (4) knowledge of program R and spatial software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS), with an aptitude for learning additional software as needed (e.g., JAGS, nimble); (5) a driver's license and ability to conduct independent field work in difficult conditions (e.g., cold, rainy/snowy, and wet conditions); (6) strong oral and written communication skills; and (7) experience interacting with state wildlife agencies and working in teams.

To apply please email a single PDF to Dr. Brent Pease (bpease1@siu.edu) that includes:    

1. A cover letter that describes past experiences and career goals
2. Curriculum Vitae (with GPA and GRE scores included)

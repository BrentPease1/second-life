# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Wildlife managers need reliable information on species distributions (i.e. patterns of occurrence and abundance) to make effective decisions. Historically, managers have relied on harvest records (collected at broad spatial extents but coarse resolution) to monitor wildlife populations. However, emerging citizen-science datastreams can potentially supplement harvest-based monitoring by providing fine-resolution data that permit identification of species-environment relationships needed to predict occurrence and abundance. We combined harvest records and citizen-science camera-trap data in integrated species distribution models (iSDMs) to estimate species-environment relationships and distribution patterns of six wildlife species in Wisconsin, USA.

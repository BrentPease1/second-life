# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Decades of research on species distributions has revealed geographic variation in species-environment relationships for a given species. That is, the way a species uses the local environment varies across geographic space. However, the drivers underlying this variation are contested and still largely unexplored. Niche traits that are conserved should reflect the evolutionary history of a species whereas more flexible ecological traits could vary at finer scales, reflecting local adaptation. We used mammal observations during a 5-year period from the iNaturalist biodiversity database and a local ensemble modelling approach to explore spatial variation in American black bear (Ursus americanus) relationships with eight ecological correlates. We tested four biologically driven hypotheses to explain the patterns of local adaptation. We evaluated non-stationarity in ecological relationships using a Stationarity Index and tested predictive performance using an independent, national-level animal occurrence data set.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Although cougars (Puma concolor) appear to be recolonizing the midwestern United States, there is concern that hunting in source populations may prevent cougars from dispersing eastward. We use carcass data of cougars in the Midwest collected during 1990â€“2015 to quantify whether cougar hunting in the Black Hills affected cougar distribution and presence in the Midwest.

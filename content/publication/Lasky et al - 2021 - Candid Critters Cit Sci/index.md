# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Citizen science projects that use camera traps to collect data can collect large-scale data without compromising information quality. However, project management challenges are increased when data collection is scaled up. Here, we provide an overview of our efforts to conduct a large-scale citizen science project using camera traps — North Carolina’s Candid Critters.

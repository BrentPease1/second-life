Isaac is studying the potential benefits of solar fields for grassland-dependent wildlife. He will be determining species richness and abundance of small mammals, meso-mammals, birds, arthropods, snakes, and salamanders on a newly restored native grassland. In my free time Isaac enjoy birding, hiking, running, and reading a good book.

Kelly is a master's student looking at how urbanization, invasive predators, and disease dynamics are affecting mesopredator populations on Key Largo, FL. Her project utilizes GPS collars and spatial analyses to study the impacts of these variables on raccoon and opossum ecology. When not looking at GPS points, you can find Kelly birding in the woods, watching movies with friends, cross country skiing, or salsa dancing

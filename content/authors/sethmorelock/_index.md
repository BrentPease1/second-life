Seth is a PhD student using camera trapping, thermal imaging (UAV and vehicle surveys), and GPS collars to measure white-tailed deer densities throughout parts of Illinois. He is co-advised by Dr. Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau in the Zoology Program. For his Master’s thesis, he studied how regenerative grazed cattle farms impacts bat activity in southern Appalachia. Seth enjoys hunting, fishing, and hiking during his free time.

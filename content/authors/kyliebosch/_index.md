Kylie is a masterâ€™s student studying swamp rabbits in southern Missouri. Her project will use occupancy modelling to investigate the distribution dynamics of swampers over the last few decades with a focus on the landscape and management factors driving these data. In her free time, you can find her hiking, riding her horses, playing with her dogs, reading, and spending time in her home state of Michigan.

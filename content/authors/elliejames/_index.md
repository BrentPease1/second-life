Ellie joined the PEASE Lab after graduating from SIU with two degrees - Forestry and Geography/Environmental Resources. Ellie is co-advised with Dr. Eric Holzmueller (SIU Forestry) and her research project focuses on using LiDAR to map the distribution of invasive plant species in southern Illinois. Her research will inform management strategies and impacts of invasive species on forest structure dynamics. Ellie enjoys volunteer work, hiking, thrifting, yoga, and reading.

Lucy is a masterâ€™s student using bioacoustics to study Wild Turkeys in Illinois. Her project focuses on determining the gobbling chronology of Wild Turkeys to help inform hunting regulations in Illinois. She is co-advised by Dr. Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau. In her free time, Lucy enjoys birding, baking bread, and watching movies.

Chris is a master’s student studying Wild Turkey Nesting Phenology in Illinois. His project will use “backpack” style radio-transmitters to track turkey throughout the nesting and brooding season. He is co-advised by Dr. Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau. When not chasing birds Chris enjoys fishing, camping, reading and, watching movies.

Shasta is a master's student investigating cerulean warbler distribution and habitat throughout Southern Illinois. Their project will utilize acoustic monitoring technology to determine presence/absence of avian species throughout many site locations spanning across 16 counties in Southern Illinois, as well as investigating the forest structure and composition in these site locations. In their free time, they enjoy drawing, painting, whittling, hiking, fishing, playing video games, and spending time with friends.

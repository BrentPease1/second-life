Karina is a Master's student interested in applying technology to improve natural resource conservation. Her project will focus on obtaining ecological insights from citizen science data from programs like iNaturalist. Karina completed an undergraduate thesis at UF using remotely-sensed data to study the factors influencing human-caused wildfire occurrence in the southeastern United States. When she is not busy doing research, she loves to fish, hike, read, play games, and photograph wildlife.

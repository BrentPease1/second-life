Haley is a PhD student studying the use of bioacoustics for density estimation of nightjars in Indiana. Her project is also part of an ongoing [100-year study](https://heeforeststudy.org/) of forest management and its impact on wildlife. For her masterâ€™s thesis, she studied secretive marsh bird habitat associations and occupancy using acoustic recording units in Tennessee. In her free time, she enjoys photography, birding, hiking and reading.

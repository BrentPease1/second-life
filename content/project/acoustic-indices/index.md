Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a sampling technique that has gained increasing popularity in the field of wildlife monitoring and research. The technique involves the deployment of programmable ARUs, allowing for non-invasive and cost-effective collection of acoustic information across a breadth of temporal and spatial scales. Retrieving biological information from PAM recordings can often involve time-consuming sound annotation methodologies, but the advent of acoustic indices has allowed for biodiversity metrics to be estimated quickly and with reasonable accuracy. [Rebecca Ducay](https://peaselab.com/people/rebecca-ducay/) (Current MS student) is developing artificial soundscapes for studying how vehicular noise affects biodiversity estimates from 9 acoustic indices. By contributing to the collective understanding of acoustic index behaviors under anthropogenic noise pollution, we hope to better inform their ecological application within future PAM efforts in human-developed contexts.

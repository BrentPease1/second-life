We have several ongoing projects within the lab testing and comparing ARU performance across hardware models. We additionally have been exploring several approaches for efficiently using BirdNET Analyzer, and how to best optimize BirdNET Analyzer for different targeted uses. Pictured is a field test comparing 4 ARU models and effects of height on deployment.

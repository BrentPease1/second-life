Wild turkey populations are a valued resource in Illinois, providing both recreational opportunities and ecological benefits. However, effective management of these populations requires balancing hunter satisfaction with sustainable harvest strategies to ensure long-term population viability. **Gobbling chronology**, the seasonal timing of male vocalizations, is thought to be a key indicator of wild turkey reproductive ecology and has direct implications for regulatory decisions surrounding hunting season dates and zones.  Despite the importance of this issue, little is known about gobbling chronology in Illinois or the broader Midwest, creating a significant gap in the data needed to inform hunting regulations and ensure sustainable management practices.

Funded by the Illinois Dept. of Natural Resources and the Wildlife Restoration Program, this state-wide project will study gobbling chronology and nesting phenology to inform regulatory decisions about the spring and fall turkey harvest seasons. [Lucy Cheeley](https://peaselab.com/people/lucy-cheeley/) and [Chris Wemmer](https://peaselab.com/people/chris-wemmer/) (Current MS students) are leading the gobbling chronology and nesting phenology work, respectively.

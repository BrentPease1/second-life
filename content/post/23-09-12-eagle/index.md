Recent research led by Dr. Pease on the economic impact of vagrant bird species - namely, the steller's sea eagle - in North America was published today in [People and Nature](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/25758314). This was a collaborative effort where we conducted online surveys to estimate individual expenditures of folks who went to see the eagle, then, using several resources, we estimated to the total number of people who went to see the bird.

Recent research led by current graduate student and lab member, Rebecca Ducay, on the impact of vehicular noise on acoustic indices was published today in [Bioacoustics](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/HEAJSPNM2CTPRXBEE4TS/full?target=10.1080/09524622.2024.2332748). Turns out cars have a big impact on estimates of species richness when using acoustic indices!

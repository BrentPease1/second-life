Kelly Crandall's article, [Human-derived food shrinks home ranges and alters resource selection of mammals at the urban-wild interface](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352249624000296?via%3Dihub), was published today in Food Webs. We documented decrease in space use in developed areas in mesopredators in an island ecosystem. Please read details at [Food Webs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352249624000296?via%3Dihub) or on our website's [publication](https://peaselab.com/publication/) page where a copy is available to read.

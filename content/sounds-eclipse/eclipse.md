We are very excited to announce that Sounds of Nature is partnering with (Eclipse Soundscapes)[https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/], a NASA-funded Citizen Science project, to study how eclipses affect life on Earth! As you may know, Carbondale, Illinois (and many other Sounds of Nature sampling locations) is in the path of totality for the (April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse)[https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5073]:
<p style="text-align: center;"> {{< figure library="true" src="path.png" >}} </p>

</br>

Southern Illinois University is heavily involved in (celebrating the eclipse)[https://eclipse.siu.edu/], and we can't think of a better way to celebrate by listening. 

To support Eclipse Soundscapes, we are offering 100 volunteers a full sampling kit to participate in the event. Good news? All you have to do is be one of the first 100 to sign up. Even better news? Eclipse Soundscapes' sampling protocol is almost identical to Sounds of Nature's approach, **so you already know how to participate!**

Priority will be given to volunteers within the path of totality, but we encourage volunteers outside of the path as well! Learning how the effects go beyond the path of totality is a goal. To participate:

1.	Head over to the Eclipse Soundscape website and sign up to a be an ES Data Collector. (Here)[https://eclipsesoundscapes.org/data-collector-page/] is the link - click on "Sign up to be an ES data collector". **IMPORTANT**: during sign-up, you MUST indicate that you heard of Eclipse Soundscapes through "Sounds of Nature" Group to receive a sampling kit from us (this is the last option on the second question of the form):
<p style="text-align: center;"> {{< figure library="true" src="sounds_group.png" >}} </p>

Signing up will do two things: 1) provide you with important information, reminders, details, etc. from Eclipse Soundscapes and 2) link you to Sounds of Nature so we can prepare a sampling kit for you. 


Once we receive the list of registered folks, the Sounds of Nature team will begin coordinating directly with you to ensure that we have mailing addresses and other information correct. 


We can't wait! Thank you for your continued support of Sounds of Nature.

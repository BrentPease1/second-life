With Campus Lake, Thompson woods, and [Touch of Nature](https://ton.siu.edu/), Southern Illinois University has a beautiful campus! The PEASE Lab has several ongoing campus and community efforts to document biodiversity across our campus. The PEASE Lab is the first US-based University to join the [Campus Biodiveristy Network](https://www.campusbiodiversitynetwork.org/en) - an organization to collectively document and monitor across global university campuses. We additionally host the annual Saluki BioBlitz, which is a 24-hour challenge to document as many species as possible on campus. See details below!
